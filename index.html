        Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast
        of sharp suits and even sharper knives. Using a unique array of cloaking
        watches, he can render himself invisible or even fake his own death,
        leaving unaware opponents off-guard. His Disguise Kit lets him take on
        the form of any class on either team, allowing him to blend in while
        behind enemy lines before stabbing his unsuspecting "teammates" in the
        back. In fact, a swift backstab with any of the Spy's knives will kill
        most foes in a single hit - provided they aren't under the effects of
        any type of invulnerability, or some other form of immense damage
        reduction.

      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <p>
        The Spy's voice actor Dennis Bateman also voices the Pyro class. The
        idea of Spy originally came from a Quake glitch, which caused players of
        the enemy team to appear as allies. A common running joke and theory is
        that the Spy is the Scout's father. This is inferred from official media
        such as the Meet the Spy short and in-game domination lines introducing
        Spy's liaisons with Scout's mother. Official comics further play into
        this speculation, with the Heavy giving a passing comment that the
        Scout's father "disappears often", and "The Naked and the Dead" comic
        having Spy to giving comfort to a dying Scout, even calling him "son"
        while disguised as Tom Jones, and grieving when Scout dies. Click on the
